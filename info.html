    Nicki Cherry’s sculptures are active sites of growth and decay—tulips bloom from stretching tendrils, milky fluids leak from latex tubing, wax candles burn and diffuse scent. They create figural forms using pigmented concrete, fiberglass, wax, and clay. Cherry punctuates these fragmented forms with materials such as medical ephemera and flowers that point towards the ways in which we care for and control ourselves. The attention to surface detail in their sculptures reflects how skin externalizes illness and emotional states, such as how acne can indicate hormonal imbalance or flushed skin can reveal embarrassment. Cherry’s work embraces the awkward and absurd to question what happens when we give into the slippery mess of our bodies and minds.
